    <h2>Ölandish frying pan bread</h2>
    <p>
      Yeast is not really necessary, flour and water is sufficient. You can use
      whatever flour you prefer (barley, wheat, rye) and mix it in a bowl with
      water, but only as much water for it to become a workable dough. These
      bread cakes can also be made on heated stones, directly on a hotplate or
      in a frying pan.
