    <h2>Rømmegrøt (Norwegian Porridge)</h2>
    <p>
      This rømmegrøt recipe is a simple mixture of milk, butter, flour, sugar,
      and salt. Our family likes to eat this warm, with a hefty drizzle of
      melted butter and a good sprinkling of cinnamon sugar!
    </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1 qt. whole milk</li>
      <li>3/4 c. all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 c. sugar</li>
      <li>1/8 tsp. kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/2 c. salted butter, plus more for serving</li>
      <li>cinnamon sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large saucepan over medium heat, heat milk to 195°F. Stir almost
        continuously so milk does not burn, scraping the bottom of the saucepan
      </li>
      <li>
        While milk is heating, whisk together flour, sugar, and salt in a small
        bowl. Set aside
      </li>
      <li>
        While milk is heating, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.
        Turn off heat and hold until milk has reached 195°F
      </li>
      <li>
        Once milk temperature has reached 195°F, stir flour mixture into melted
        butter to form a thick paste
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer to the heated milk and stir constantly until milk starts to
        boil
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn heat down to low and let cook for 5 minutes more, stirring often.
        Remove saucepan from heat
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon into individual bowls and serve with warm melted butter and
        cinnamon sugar (the more, the better!)
      </li>
    </ol>
